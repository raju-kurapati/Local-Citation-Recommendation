# Local-Citation-Recommendation

Keeping up with the latest work related to a topic is
difficult due to the exponential increase in scientific
publications. This difficulty affects how we cite oth-
ersâ€™ work during article writing. Previous research
have attempted to assist by offering citation-oriented
support, but often falls short in their accuracy, rel-
evance, and response times. In this work, we pro-
pose to use retrieval augmented classification, and
a combination of transformer-based embeddings and
semantic retrieval, to increase both relevance and ac-
curacy. We create an end-to-end architecture that
combines citation worthiness prediction and citation
recommendation at a local level. Further, we dis-
till the architecture to achieve high inference rates,
making it usable for real-time writing. We deploy
our system as a plugin for multiple popular writing
services including Google Docs and others.
